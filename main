# votes input [1,2,3,3,3] -> expected output 3
# goal is to find the employee id who will be elected as board member
# to win, an id needs n/3 votes
# n is the number of total votes


# use a loop to iterate through the list
# identify the id and the vote count
# use a dictionary to store the id and the vote count
# id as key and vote count as value
# add the vote count as iterating through the list
# check any id has at least n/3 votes
# return the id
# return -1 as default
